The root folder contains a node.js server using express. To run the server, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo on your system
2. cd to node-rest-api
3. Open a terminal within the /root folder
4. Run npm install to install all the depedencies
5. run npm sequelize-cli db:migrate
6. Run node index to start the server
The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

Hint - Use nodemon instead of node to automatically restart the server on any changes.
